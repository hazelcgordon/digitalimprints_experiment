## Original survey and corresponding variable names

### Description of survey flow

The survey is split into four stages:

- Stage 1: 
  - Participants will be randomly split into one of two conditions, and half will see ‘training’ text informing them about the new laws for increased transparency.
- Stage 2: 
  - Participants will view four pieces of campaign material, two with digital imprints and two without.  
  - The material they view with and without imprints will be randomised, so that all pieces of material will be viewed with and without an imprint by different participants.
  - They will view each piece separately, and will be asked a set of questions after each one (these questions are only included once in this document, but will be viewed four times by participants)
- Stage 3: 
  - Participants will answer the same set of questions testing their recall of the content, their confidence in regulation, knowledge of regulation and online information self-efficacy.
- Stage 4:
  - Participants will answer the same set of questions about their demographics, levels of political trust/mistrust/cynicism, and social media use.
  
### Training text

Some of the posts you might see when browsing on social media are political campaign posts.

A new transparency law for online political campaigning has just come into force. Now, most digital campaign material will require details of who paid for and produced it. This is designed to help voters know who is trying to reach them online and influence their vote.

You are about to see four randomly selected social media posts. Please review each example and answer a short number of questions about what you’ve seen.

#### No training text
