## Purpose of project

Welcome! This repository includes all the details for a survey experiment designed to test how effective political campaign digital disclosures can be in informing the public. The study was developed by a research team based at the University of Sheffield, with guidance from the Electoral Commission during the research design process. 

As we are a team based in the UK, this experiment specifically tests the 'digital imprint', a form of disclosure from UK legislation of which the Electoral Commission is responsible for providing guidance and setting out the practical details of the policy. 

Overall, this study fits within a growing body of research seeking to understand how the public use such information to make judgements about who is behind campaign material, whether they are a credible source, and so forth.
